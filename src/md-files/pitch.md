## In the depths of space...

A new universe takes shape. A new... Fiddleverse.

Complete with famous shapes such as:
- The Outrageous Octocylinder!
- The Fabulous Fiddlewing!
- The Super-stellar... StarThing!
- And more incomprehensible galactic wonder.

- PS: Our sandbox is the other four tabs included in the site, other than Pitched!

## Use Case
- For viewing pleasure and and the occasional existential crisis.

## Autonomous Animations
- After clicking the "Master Start/Stop" button, (some objects) will begin to move on their own.  The satellite is completely unmanned, so it orbits the sun on its own.  On board the UFO, Nalyd the beam operator is taking a nap instead of doing his job, so he set the beam to "auto."

## Interaction with the Scene
- You may choose from an array of buttons under the canvas. To start the animation/control, click "Master Start/Stop". From there...
- `Switch Camera` rotates the camera around 8 different viewing points.
- `Start/Stop UFO` begins the UFO's orbit around our solar system.
- `Engage UFO Camo` initiates evasive measures for the UFO if it's discovered!
- `Add/Remove Satellite` retrieves and re-launches our satellite from our space station(it's behind the camera at all times) (removal from scene)
- `Start/Stop Sun` controls the sun's rotation, which we have harnessed through our dyson sphere.
- `Launch Rocket` sends our rocket into the depths of space, never to return... until you reload the page.
- `Add/Remove Engine` removes the engine booster from the rocket to save weight. (removal from group)
