## Commentary


### What aspects of defining a 3D scene are successfully handled by your library behind the scenes?
- We have aimed to make the user experience as straightforward as possible. Therefore, all shader code, scene setup, and processing functions are handled internally. 

### What aspects are not handled behind the scenes? (i.e., the dev user needs to write code for them)
- We only require that users initialize, position, and animate their objects, while also giving them agency to create more complex structures such as groups.

### How much code for using your library is the same at the application level, regardless of the specific scene?


### What aspects of your design would you keep, if you got a chance to do this library over?


### What aspects of your design would you change?
