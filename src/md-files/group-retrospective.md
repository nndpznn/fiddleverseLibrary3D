## Group Retrospective

Throughout the project, we were essentially split into two teams: back-end and front-end. Although this workflow felt a little unstable at the beginning, everyone found their role by the end and played it well. 

Nolan and Dylan worked on the wiring and code consolidation to create Fiddleverse. 
- Dylan took point on the creation and maintenance of most of the matrix systems. He was also responsible for light and camera positioning.
- Nolan primarily handled the testing suite and the HTML/CSS/React to make the site look a little more pretty, and added more pages as needed. 
- Nolan also provided general support in the form of bug fixing, tracing code back and finding solutions to little glitches.

JD and Allen focused more on assembling and animating the scene, bringing it to life. They dealt more with the instantiation of objects, their positioning, and the use of matrices to manipulate their movement.
- They conceptualized what the scene should look like and what the composite objects should be.
- JD also wired most of the buttons on-screen that correspond to different behaviors.

Of course, we weren't relegated to these roles and would cross over fairly often to explain things to each other and provide input throughout. We found that it was important to teach each other what we were doing so that there wouldn't be too much of a built-up learning curve at the end.
