## SHAPE CREDITS!

**Scene Concept:**
For our group's scene, we wanted to create a space-themed scene utilizing the required sphere-shape as a planet.  To fill out the scene, we decided to make a cylinder-shape and wing-shape to construct a spaceship.  For the background, we also created asteroid and star-shapes.
