| • Camera | Changing camera settings is possible | 7/7 |
| • Wireframe/solid | Sphere Test claims to have a wireframe/solid toggle but it doesn’t work as intended. Fortunately, the code shows that this can be done if the UI codes it right (–2) | 5/7 |
| • Projection | Sphere Test claims to have an orthographic/perspective toggle but it doesn’t quite demonstrate things effectively. The code shows that this is happening but better values need to be used (–2) | 5/7 |
| • Aspect ratio | Viewport appears to be non-square and matches the aspect ratio | 7/7 |
| • Scene add/remove | Scene addition and removal appears to work as expected | 7/7 |

| Code maintainability | There is one lingering warning due to an unused variable. When submitting a final (“production”) version of an assignment, please make sure that it is clean and that all possible errors have been checked (–1) | -1 |
| Code readability | There are apparently still some holdouts on using the Prettier autoformatter (e.g., _spherePage.js_) (–2) | -2 |
