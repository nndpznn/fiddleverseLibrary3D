**CMSI 3710** Computer Graphics, Spring 2024

# Assignment 0429
We end our computer graphics journey the way we began: by putting together an animated, interactive 3D scene. But this time, the higher-level library that we will use is the one that we have made‚Äîsomething that, in our field, is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúeating our own dog food‚Äù üêï

## Background Reading
Pretty much anything is fair game at this point‚Äîeverything ranging from _three.js_ (to see how ‚Äúthey‚Äù designed things) to the textbooks (theoretical, programming, _and_ reference) to the starter code to the additional course website materials. Not much more to say here except to refer back to those sources as needed.

## For Submission
Make two three-dimensional scenes implemented via your 3D library. The specifications are as follows:

### Sandbox Scene
Implement a scene that is very similar to the test scenes you have created so far (in fact it can even be the same scene)‚Äîsomething abstract or random, used to demonstrate or try out certain library features. You‚Äôll see why this is useful later.

### Pitched Scene
The second scene to implement follows the same pattern as before‚Äîif anything sounds a lot like the instructions from the very first assignment‚Ä¶well, that‚Äôs by design.

#### Have a Pitch
Develop your second scene with a concrete _use case_ in mind‚Äîin other words, don‚Äôt let it be a meaningless collection of objects (the way the starter code‚Äîor your sandbox scene‚Äîis üòÖ). To that end, supply a _pitch.md_ file that frames your scene in some context. Is it the beginnings of a story? The basis for a game? The foundation for a simulation? Setting up a pitch that excites your entire group will seed your ideas and explorations.

Note the use of words like ‚Äúbeginning,‚Äù ‚Äúbasis,‚Äù or ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù‚Äîthe final result of this assignment doesn‚Äôt need to be fully-formed. However, it must be _self-sufficient_: i.e., it might not be feature-complete, but the features that _are_ present are functional and bug-free.

#### Keep Some Motion in the Ocean
The scene must have something that is _autonomously animated_‚Äîi.e., one or more things about the scene must change over time even if the user does nothing. This animation must be described in _pitch.md_. (so I know that it is intended behavior)

#### Give the User Something to Do
Conversely, the scene must also have something that is _interactive_‚Äîi.e., the user can perform one or more actions that will affect the scene dynamically. Instructions for this interactivity should be described in _pitch.md_. (so I know what to do when I fire up your scene)

#### Get Lit üí°
Give your scene an appropriate lighting scheme and make sure that all objects respond to lighting as intended.

#### Demonstrate that You Have the Technology
To guide your choices on animation and interaction, make sure that your pitched scene uses the following capabilities of your library. You are free to fit the capability to your use case‚Äîyou may choose to show these either via autonomous animation or interaction, but make sure you _show_ all of them one way or the other without having to change the scene‚Äôs source code:
* Ability to change camera position and viewpoint
* Ability to toggle between wireframe and solid rendering
* Ability to toggle between orthographic and perspective projection (you may choose the viewing volume parameters as appropriate for each type of projection)
* A _non-square_ canvas whose aspect ratio matches that of both viewing volumes
* Ability to add and remove objects to/from the scene
* Ability to add and remove objects to/from groups
* Ability to compute lighting in both faceted/flat and smooth styles

#### Be Individually Responsible for a Group (Composite) ‚ÄúCharacter‚Äù
Each individual member of the group must be clearly in charge of or responsible for at least one ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù or object in the scene. The group can collaborate on it but a specific member must have primary responsibility for that object. Concretely speaking, the majority of commits for that character or object‚Äôs code must be by the responsible member. As you might expect, this part is to be graded individually.
* The character must be a _composite_ object‚Äîi.e., it should use whatever group construct you defined for your library
* The character must have an _internal_ moving part, like a rotating arm, a head that turns, a door that opens, etc. (yes, this is meant to show off your implementation of parent transforms being correctly applied to child objects)

Document the distribution of responsibility by providing a _credits.md_ file that states which character or object was the primary responsibility of which member.

Not all scene objects have to be individual‚Äîsome aspects may be fully shared by the group. But each member must be in charge of at least one. This ensures that your scene will have, at a bare minimum, at least as many characters/objects as you have group members.

#### Implementation Tips & Notes
* In the process of developing your scene, you might realize that you need to create new shapes or modify/tweak existing ones‚Äîwell you know how to create them from nothing now, so go right ahead and customize as needed
* Similarly, you might feel like certain refactors or redesigns are called for in your library‚Äîfeel free to do those
* Further, you might be inspired to improve or add features to your library (texture mapping; improved lighting)‚Äîgo for it! Information for how to implement those _can_ be found‚Ä¶some of them right in the recommended texts

### Assess Your Design
One reason for asking you to implement _two_ scenes is to allow you to assess your design choices. Does your design effectively hide boilerplate code? How much code has to be repeated across scenes? How much of the scene code is genuinely specific to the actual scene being built?

Provide a _commentary.md_ file that looks back on your design choices and answers at least these questions:
1. What aspects of defining a 3D scene are successfully handled by your library behind the scenes?
2. What aspects are _not_ handled behind the scenes? (i.e., the dev user needs to write code for them)
3. How much code for using your library is the same at the application level, regardless of the specific scene?
4. What aspects of your design would you keep, if you got a chance to do this library over?
5. What aspects of your design would you change?

### Extra Learnings
A few aspects of the graphics pipeline remain, but they are difficult to apply at our level because WebGL performs these operations for us ‚Äúfor free.‚Äù As such, the following topics will be covered _in class only_:
1. Clipping
2. Hidden surface removal

All you need to do is be in class for these topics, and that will determine the score for this section.

### Extra Yearnings
An open-ended pool of points can be awarded for extra credit if your 3D library implements features above and beyond the baseline for this part of the course. This is open-ended precisely because the possibilities are open-ended. Some parameters:
* The feature cannot be something for which you have already received extra credit
* Extra credit can be group or individual, and for the latter it must be very clear (either via the commit log or mutual acknowledgement by group members) that the extra feature was predominantly worked on by that individual
* Make sure that the fundamentals (the other specifications requested earlier) are handled sufficiently before even _thinking_ about aiming for these ‚Äúextra yearnings‚Äù‚ÄîI reserve the right to withhold extra credit if this is attempted but something more basic has not been handled well

Examples or possibilities include:
* A more advanced/sophisticated lighting model
* Non-trivial new material characteristics
* Texture mapping
* Shadows
* Reflection
* Blending

‚Ä¶and many more!

What won‚Äôt count:
* New shapes‚Äîat this point these should be pretty straightforward to generate, and even if they require additional programming, these computations are independent of the core graphics pipeline (unike the capabilities listed above)
* File import/export‚Äîthis was available for extra credit earlier but, like shapes, they are outside the core graphics pipeline so if you haven‚Äôt implemented this yet, the ship has sailed
* Test suite‚Äîsame reasoning‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not one to discourage automated testing but this is also outside the central flow of graphics calculations

‚Ä¶so note that the priority here isn‚Äôt just any additional feature, but those that involve expansion or enhancement of the graphics pipeline itself.

### Statement of Work Retrospective
* Reflect on your overall group graphics work for the entire ‚ÄúOur Own Library‚Äù sequence in a _group-retrospective.md_ document. Describe what each group member worked on through all of the assignments as well as this last pair of scenes
* Write an individual email directly to me stating anything that you prefer not to include in the shared _group-retrospective.md_‚Äîeven if you have nothing to add, _write to me anyway_, so I know that you didn‚Äôt miss a chance to speak up. So that I don‚Äôt miss it, use the subject line ‚ÄúCMSI 3710 _group name_ individual statement of work‚Äù

The points for this deliverable pertain to _submission only_ and not its content. If warranted, individual adjustments to final grades may be made based on the information provided in these items.

```bash
$ git tag assignment-0429
$ git push --tags
```

For non-code deliverables, we reinterpret outcomes _4b_ and _4c_ in this assignment to represent the clarity, polish, and effectiveness of how you document your scene and its features.

Note that inability to compile and run any code to begin with will negatively affect other criteria, because if we can‚Äôt run your code (or commands), we can‚Äôt evaluate related remaining items completely.
