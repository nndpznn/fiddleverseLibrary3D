# _Our_ 3D Scene Assignments
You may think of this last chunk of work as one assignment in four parts, or four assignments that build on the same code base. Either way, the intended result is the same:
* A 3D graphics framework of your design, with rudimentary geometry, transformation, material, and lighting features
* An interactive 3D scene that is implemented with this framework

The multipart aspect of these assignments motivates distinct instructions files living in one repository. Here are the parts:

- [Assignment 0325a](./static-3d-scene.md) Static scene based on _our_ polygon mesh library
- [Assignment 0325b](./matrix-library.md) _Our_ own matrix library
- [Assignment 0410](./lights-camera.md) _Our_ lights, _our_ cameraâ€¦
- [Assignment 0429](./action.md) â€¦_Your_ action!

Welcome to the world of 3D graphics! Hope you enjoy your visit ðŸ˜Ž
