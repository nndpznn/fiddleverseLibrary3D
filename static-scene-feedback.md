| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Stub web app | Stub web app provides testbed for scene library | 5/5 |
| | **Screen construct/framework** | |
| â€¢Â Setup | Scene code is structured to handle WebGL setup and connection to `canvas` in a reusable manner | 4/4 |
| â€¢Â Add/remove | `Scene` handles addition and removal | 4/4 |
| â€¢Â Rendering | Universe code renders to a canvas in a reusable manner | 4/4 |
| â€¢Â Implementation | Make sure to make a scene object, currently your universe is holding this data.  | 3/3 |
| | **3D object framework** | |
| â€¢Â Different shapes | Framework accommodates different shapes | 2/2 |
| â€¢Â Color | 3D object framework stores at least a single color | 2/2 |
| â€¢Â Groups/composites | 3D object framework includes a proper group/composite construct. | 8/8 |
| â€¢Â Implementation | 3D object framework implementation is clear and straightforward. | 3/3 |
| | **Polygon mesh data structure** | |
| â€¢Â Vertices/triangles | Mesh data structure stores vertices and faces (triangles) appropriately.  | 10/10 |
| â€¢Â Extensibility | Mesh data structure design allows for easy extension to accommodate future values | 5/5 |
| â€¢Â Solid vs. wireframe | Mesh data structure produces wireframe and solid renders in a straightforward manner. | 5/5 |
| â€¢Â Implementation | Mesh implementation is done well. | 5/5 |
| | **Mesh maker library** | |
| â€¢Â Sphere | Sphere is implemented correctly | 20/20 |
| â€¢Â _shape-credits.md_ | Credits present |  |
| â€¢Â Implementation | Shape framework done wellâ€”it would have been nice though to still have a version with multiple shapes in the sandbox page rather than having solely individual pages and individual fiddleverses for each shape, to show that your scene can hold multiple shapes without a problem (true though that the multiple demos show that you can create multiple fiddleverses easily) | 10/10 |
| Extra credit (if any) | 1 test (+1) | 1 |
| Code maintainability | No issues with maintainability |  |
| Code readability | Alright readability, make sure for final submission all commented code is gone. |  |
| Version control | Decent commit granularity with sufficiently descriptive messages; Nolan and Dylan dominate the commit countsâ€¦that part can be better. Allen isnâ€™t on the board at all |  |
| Punctuality | Tagged commit made on 3/26 12:00am. Technically one second late but weâ€™ll let that go ðŸ˜„<br /><br /> **Graded commit:** [24e67f8d3c8eeb036c48e49cc6b3e08193f7428e](https://github.com/lmu-cmsi3710-spring2024/our-own-3d-library-fiddlesticks/commit/24e67f8d3c8eeb036c48e49cc6b3e08193f7428e) |  |
